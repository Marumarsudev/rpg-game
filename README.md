RPG-Game school project.

2D gladiator arena game, where the player's goal is to defeat (waves) of enemies in an arena.
Defeating each enemy gives the player xp. After enough xp is gained the player levels up and gains x attribute points,
which can be used to improve skills such as strength and dexterity. If the player manages to defeat all of the (waves and) enemies.
Receives the player a cash prize that can be used to purchase different goods ranging from weapons and armor to potions and other useful items.

After this initial arena-mode idea has been implemented, there might be a chance for a larger story or an open world.
